Project Title: Face Recognition Attendance System

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, face recognition, NumPy, Pickle

Description: The Face Recognition Attendance System is designed to automatically
log student attendance using real-time face detection and recognition.
It captures webcam footage and detects faces using dlibâ€™s
(face_recognition library). The system compares detected faces with
pre-stored face encodings and logs attendance when a match is found.
The system also displays the student's name and ID, with an user
interface by overlaying webcam footage with a background image
